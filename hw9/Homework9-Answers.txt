# This document details how the browser interacts with Boneserver

1.  For example, when when connect() is callex in MatrixLED.js, Boneserver creates creates an i2c socket to the LED matrix which allows for the relay of information.

2.  When an LED is clicked in the browser, LEDclick(i,j) with the coordiates of the click, toggles the value of the LED matrix, and writes to it over i2c.

3.  For example, the .on paramter contains a background-color paramater, which colors the LED.


4. In regards to how I will control the two LEDS, I will create a new class onRed, so when the LED gets clicked a second time, the LED matrix disables the green class, and enables the red class. Next, since around line 86 in matrixLED.js the red lines are ignored, I will not ignore the red pixels and  swtich between enabling the green and red pixels at any given LED.
